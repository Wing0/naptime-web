# SEO & Visibility Guide for Naptime

I have already implemented the **Technical SEO** foundation for your site:
- [x] **Meta Tags**: Added keywords, social sharing tags (Open Graph, Twitter Cards), and canonical links.
- [x] **Sitemap**: Created `sitemap.xml` so search engines can find all your pages.
- [x] **Robots.txt**: Created `robots.txt` to guide crawlers.

## Next Steps to Improve Reach

### 1. Submit to Search Engines
You need to "tell" Google and Bing that your site exists.
- **Google Search Console**:
    1.  Go to [search.google.com/search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console).
    2.  Add a property for `https://naptime.info`.
    3.  Verify ownership (you can use the "HTML tag" method or DNS record method).
    4.  Submit your sitemap: `https://naptime.info/sitemap.xml`.
- **Bing Webmaster Tools**: Similar process for Bing/Yahoo.

### 2. Social Media Presence
- Create dedicated accounts for **Naptime App** on:
    - **X (Twitter)**: Share tips about sleep, napping, and productivity.
    - **Instagram**: Post visuals of the app and relaxing aesthetic content.
    - **TikTok**: Short videos showing "The Naptime Challenge" (trying to nap for exactly 20 mins).

### 3. Community Engagement
Identify where your "power nappers" hang out:
- **Reddit**: Subreddits like `r/productivity`, `r/sleep`, `r/students`, `r/polyphasic`.
    - *Action*: Share your story ("I built an app to help me nap better") rather than just spamming a link.
- **Product Hunt**: Plan a launch here. It's the #1 place for new tech products.
    - Prepare high-quality screenshots (we have these now).
    - Write a compelling story.

### 4. Content Marketing (Blog)
Consider adding a **Blog** section later.
- Write articles like:
    - "The Science of the 20-Minute Power Nap"
    - "Why You Feel Groggy After Napping (And How to Fix It)"
    - "Best Times of Day to Nap"
- These articles capture people searching for *answers*, not just an app.

### 5. App Store Optimization (ASO)
Since the goal is to get app downloads:
- Ensure your Google Play Store listing has:
    - The same high-quality keywords ("sleep tracker", "power nap", "smart alarm").
    - A video preview.
    - High-quality screenshots.
